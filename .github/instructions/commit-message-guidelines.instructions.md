# Commit Message Guidelines

Generate commit messages in English following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification. Your analysis MUST be based ONLY on the files in the staging area (`git diff --staged`). Do not consider unstaged files.

## Allowed Types

- feat: A new feature
- fix: A bug fix
- docs: Documentation-only changes
- style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (e.g., white-space, formatting)
- refactor: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- perf: A code change that improves performance
- test: Adding or correcting tests
- build: Changes to the build system or external dependencies
- ci: Changes to CI configuration or scripts
- chore: Other changes that donâ€™t modify src or test files

## Expected Structure

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>

<optional body>

<optional footer(s)>
```
